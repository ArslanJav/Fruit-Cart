# Fruit-Cart

Fruit cart is a way to add individual fruits whcih us then updated in the system (DOM) or removing the individual fruit items all at once.

This site was created to practice array in JavaScript and how to manipulate the data.
(The code/structure could be alot cleaner but I found this method to work)
